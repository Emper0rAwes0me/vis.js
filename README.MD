- As of right now, those on clanware are not permitted to join the group or attend events.
- Those present on our blacklist will not be allowed to join the group or attend any of our defences.

You will be banned from this server and exiled from the group for any notable violation of the above rule sets.

# Enforcement
- Minor offences will follow a three-strike policy.
- Disputes will lead to a warning followed up by a timeout if necessary.
- Attempting to circumvent a ban or moderator action will result in being blacklisted.
- The three-strike policy may be neglected when deemed necessary.

# Verification
- To get started, pend for the group.
- Use `/verify` and follow the instructions you are DM'd by <@1207118987721183262>
- If your roles are incorrect, you can use `/updateroles` to retrieve any missing roles. This will only work if you have previously verified.

# Progression
At the end of every event, attendees will be awarded Lum. The amount varies depending on the outcomes and location:
- **Fort victory:** 4
- **Fort loss:** 2
- **Fairzone victory:** 3
- **Fairzone loss:** 1

You may check how much Lum you or another member has acquired using `/viewlum`.

The Lum requirement for each rank is as follows:
- **Initiate:** 0
- **Auxiliary:** 25
- **Guard:** 61
- **Sentry:** 245
- **Tactician:** 393
- **Titan:** 797

The Honorary rank is awarded to those who show notable contributions to the group. It is not easy to obtain.

HRs are selected through a combination of applications and Council approval.
Council members may be appointed at any time. In most cases, this will be an existing HR.
